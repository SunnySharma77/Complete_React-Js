# React Introduction

## What is React?
React is a **JavaScript library** for building **user interfaces**. It was developed by **Facebook (Meta)** and is widely used for creating fast, scalable, and interactive web applications. React follows a **component-based architecture**, allowing developers to build reusable UI components.

## Why Use React?

- 🚀 **Fast and Efficient** – Uses a Virtual DOM for optimized rendering.
- ⚛️ **Component-Based** – Develop modular, reusable UI components.
- 🔄 **Unidirectional Data Flow** – Ensures better state management and predictability.
- 🌎 **SEO-Friendly** – Supports server-side rendering with frameworks like Next.js.
- 📦 **Rich Ecosystem** – Works with Redux, React Router, Material-UI, etc.
- 💼 **Industry Standard** – Used by companies like Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, and Netflix.

## Getting Started with React

To create a new React app, use the following command:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

This will start a development server, and you can begin building your React application.

## Basic React Component Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React! 🚀</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
